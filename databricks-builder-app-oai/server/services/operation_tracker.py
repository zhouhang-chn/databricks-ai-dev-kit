"""Thread-safe operation tracker for async tool execution.

When MCP tools take longer than a safe threshold, they return immediately
with an operation ID. The operation continues in the background and can
be polled via check_operation_status().

This keeps the model stream responsive during long-running operations by
allowing frequent polling interactions instead of blocking calls.
